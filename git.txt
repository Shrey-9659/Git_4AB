git status

Whenever you want to track a particular program, the very first thing you do is initializing that repository

to initializing the repository type "git init" in your terminal
NOTE : Make sure you are in the correct folder.

To commit any particular changes, I have to push my files and folders to the staging area.
git add fileName
git add fileName1, fileName2, fileName3, fileName4
git add fileName
